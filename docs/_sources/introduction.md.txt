MyST Editor is a collaborative Markdown editor. 
It uses [MyST](https://mystmd.org/) - a Markdown flavor intended for technical documentation.
For a general introduction to the MyST syntax, please refer to the [MyST Markdown Guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-myst-markdown).
The goal of this manual is to introduce the editor's features and describe how to use them effectively.

This manual consists of the following chapters:

- [](topbar.md) - discusses the elements of the editor topbar
- [](collaboration.md) - discusses functionalities related to collaborative edition
- [](mermaid.md) - discusses support for [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/)
- [](rich-links.md) - introduces editor-specific syntax for linking to external entities
